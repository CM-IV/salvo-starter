# Introduction
This is a project generated by [salvo-cli](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-cli). You can run the program and test according to the following commands (for non-sqlite databases, please modify the database connection string first according to the tutorial, and complete the initial work of the data).
üòÑ The latest version of Salvo requires Rust version 1.75. If your compilation fails, please try upgrading with `rustup update`.
``` shell
//Run the project
cargo run 
//Run tests
cargo test
```
# Tip
- If you choose sqlite or have initialized the data in the users table, please use the account zhangsan with password 123 to login.
- The database connection string is in config/config.toml, but if you use sqlx or seaorm, the library itself reads the configuration from .env file to generate entities, run migrations, and validate. So when you modify the database connection string, you need to change two places at the same time.

üéØ You have chosen sqlx, documentation can be viewed here:https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx
## sqlx_cli
SQLx&#x27;s associated command-line utility for managing databases, migrations, and enabling &quot;offline&quot; mode with sqlx::query!() and friends. https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/main/sqlx-cli/README.md
## Data initialization
You have chosen sqlite database, the database has been initialized in the data folder.
